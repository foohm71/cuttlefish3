Lowering payments often resulted in interest negating progress, extending the repayment period and increasing total debt.\\n\\n2. **Unclear or Uncommunicated Loan Terms and Transfers:** Borrowers reported being inadequately informed about when payments would resume, changes in loan servicers (e.g., from Great Lakes to Nelnet or Navient) without proper notification, or being unaware of the precise status of their loans. This lack of communication led to missed payments or delinquency.\\n\\n3. **Lack of Assistance or Proper Payment Plans:** Several complaints indicated that borrowers could not get proper repayment plans, or their attempts to request income-driven repayment plans or to establish payment schedules were ignored or met with denial.\\n\\n4. **Issues with Loan Servicers and Data Management:** Problems such as incorrect account information, inability to apply payments correctly (e.g., funds only applied to interest, not principal), and mishandling of payments or account transfers caused confusion and unintentional delinquency.\\n\\n5. **Systemic Lack of Transparency and Information:** Many borrowers felt misled or inadequately informed about their loan conditions, interest rates, accruing debt, and their rights, which contributed to financial hardship and difficulty in making timely payments.\\n\\n6. **Economic Hardship and Stagnant Wages:** Several borrowers cited economic hardships—including unemployment, low wages, or job loss—as reasons incapable of keeping up with payments, especially when compounded by rising interest or unmanageable debt burdens.\\n\\nOverall, the combination of poor communication, limited repayment options, servicer mishandling, and personal financial hardships contributed to many borrowers' inability to pay back their loans.\""

Also sometimes the user did not write the query in a well structured or incomplete form, getting the LLM to reformulate the query could help correct that - thus leading to more relevant chunks being retireved.

    "3. We will chunk each of those documents into smaller documents, and associate them with their respective parents, and store those in a VectorStore. We'll call those \"child chunks\".\n",
    "4. When we query our Retriever, we will do a similarity search comparing our query vector to the \"child chunks\".\n",

    "I posed the question of what happens when we apply semantic chunking to documents with short and highly repetitive sentences to Cursor (see PROMPTS.md) and my understanding is this: since semantic chunking relies on semantic variation to detect natural breakpoints and short, repetitive sentences have high similarity and low variation it could lead to very large meaningless chunks or over-fragmentation (tiny+meaningless chunks). To adjust the algorithm to work better, one way would be to exploit structure (eg. TOC Chunker) since the document is already somewhat structured for context coherence in the sections:\n",

    "\n",
    "The results are really interesting. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Right out of the bat, **Context Entity Recall** was all 0. I was pretty perplexed by this so I checked with Cursor (see PROMPTS.md - Prompt 5). The key idea behind Context Entity Recall are of course entities. The reason why we are seeing that metric to be zero is that a lot of the entities in the data are **anonymized** as they may be PII. So a value of zero is **to be expected**\n",
    "* Next is **Response Relevancy** as it is ultimately what we are looking for in a RAG. Interestingly the Naive approach has the best score but not by much to the next best - Contextual Compression. This makes sense cos the data is smaller so over optimizing on the chunking or retrieval could be counter productive. But let's look at the cost/latency: the contextual compression improved the latency by **half**. Cost wise it's also half but we are not including the cost of using Cohere's model so that needs to be factored in. In this particular case Naive was ~ $0.20 for the whole run and Context Compression was ~ $0.15 but this could change if pricing changes. \n",
    "* Next is **Faithfulness** - both Naive and BM25 have a score of 1 and all the rest are close (0.98-0.99) except for *Contextual Compression* (0.93). My hunch why this was the case is that compared to the exercise we did previously using PDF documents, we are dealing with customer complaints and the data being smaller, it would not lend itself well to the extra work of going thru the compression. So I checked with Cursor on this and that hunch seems to be confirmed. According to Cursor (see Prompt 6) we are doing more harm than good because (a) limited context pool - reranking removes useful info (b) over-optimization filtering context that's actually needed. In essence, less context == less faithful answers\n",
    "* **Factual Correctness** - Most of the approaches are close. Parent Doc is the worst but not by far. That makes sense cos the data is so small it actually hurts the overall Factual Correctness score when we try to split it even more. \n",
    "* **Context Recall** - Ensemble had a perfect score but Context Compression had the lowest score at 0.90 and we've seen this before in the last exercise cos just because your retrieved chunks are semantically similar doesn't mean it is relevant to the question. \n",
    "* **Noise Sensitivity** - both Naive and BM25 perform worse than the rest which makes sense since (a) BM25 is keyword search hence we are not using semantic similarity so it works best if the query contains important keywords otherwise it could be taken for a ride (b) as for Naive approach - all the other methods are trying to get more semantically similar chunks (than the Naive approach) into the context hence it makes sense that the Naive approach is has a lower noise sensitivity "
